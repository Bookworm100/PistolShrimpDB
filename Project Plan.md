# The overall plan for this project:

-	During weeks 4-5, I plan to implement the main storage format (which, right now, involves blocks of 1 kilobyte per key-value pair, marked with a tag indicating whether that block is free for overwriting). I also plan to implement the basic framework, which includes a function for inserting and deleting from the key-value store.
-	During weeks 5-6, I plan to implement the parser used for the key-value store. This may involve the use of an existing parser library such as regex. (It would be nice to include the client or user input part, but it is not required for now). I also plan to implement basic selects by the end of week 6.
-	During week 5, I also plan to design the poster. 
-	During week 7 (when meeting of the minds is) I plan to implement all the other selects I intend to implement (I will have that figured out in the next few days).
-	During weeks 8-9, I plan to implement searching, and a more intricate update instead of deleting the old pair and inserting the modified one would be nice to have. 
-	During weeks 9-11, I plan to debug to make the storage ready for demoing and prepare the presentation.
