# About Me and this project

Hi! I'm Vibha Vijayakumar, currently a junior at Caltech majoring in Computer Science. 


This project is for my CS 123 class, Projects in Database Systems. I'm implementing a pretty simple key-value store to understand and show off some awesome things that can be done with a simple understanding of Python and lots (I'm not kidding, **LOTS**) of data!

Stay tuned as I continue working on this project and finish implementing features!
