# Future Work

1. Because of my rushed fix for spaces, I needed to process commands with commas versus and/ors separately and added some lines of code. In the future, I would like to find a way to parse them all together and have the modules using these parsed commands (Delete, Insert, Selects, Searches, Finds, Updates) use one main streamlined process for processing commands (right now, for Delete and Selects, I use two avenues, which I think I could combine with more time).
2. More and more consolidation is nice, as is the need for fewer modules and fewer lines of code as they will hopefully be more robust, provided they still work. One modification that could help is decrlaring an abstract class for the different commands, and then having the commands themselves be derived classes, as their structures as implemented are already similar.
3. If I had more time, I would test out more random, junk inputs, for now at least some of the burden is still on the user. I try catching erroneous ones and print usages, so for most of my testing so far, the user will likely know what the issue might be.
4. I could always use nice, efficient parsers! I manually examine the code, but it would be nice to have a parser help me directly jump to the case and have the process be more automated.
5. It would be nice to change command automatically to lowercase, and it's likely very doable, but I don't have time right now.
6. I would like to better use typesets for efficiency, such as first checking if the provided column type for Selects/Deletes are in an existing type and that way if it isn't, we can ignore the command and let the user know more quickly. Additionally, we can more quickly scan through Searches/Finds for more likely candidates that meet the search criteria for the cases where the user specifies a candidate column type.
7. Because I caught that renaming may not necessarily be saved in the storage file late, I quickly added a snipet that when saving, to add the renamed rows to the updated rows and have the storage file updated that way. There is probably a more efficient way to combine these changes.
