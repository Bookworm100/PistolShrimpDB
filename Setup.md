# Setting up

This will tell you how to set up the key value store! Yay!
(Note: This has been only tested on Windows, but as far as I know it should work on all OSes)

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+
2. Retrieve the files from this GitHub repository - namely those titled PistolShrimpStoreDB.
3. Get JSON data (example data is available from https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD).
4. You can start running the program and have fun with the large amount of data! To do so, in the directory of your installation, run main.py.
5. You will be prompted for the following three things: a filename to load data from, a keyword specifying 


Bonus: If you're feeling up to it, you can start up the program and type "exit" to initially set up the storage file. You can also start browsing through and making changes based on the commands specified in Usage.md!

Coming soon - demonstration examples that you can use to test out this program!
