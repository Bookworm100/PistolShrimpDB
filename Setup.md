## Setting up
(Note: this only works properly on Python 3.7+)
This will tell you how to set up the key value store! Yay!

1. Retrieve the files (namely Main.py from this repository).
2. Get the JSON data (now it's for data from https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD).
3. Title it "AirQualityMeasures.json" and make sure to store it in the same directory as where you are running the store itself.
4. Now you're done! You can start running the program and have fun with the large amount of data!

Bonus: If you're feeling up to it, you can start up the program and type "exit" to initially set up the storage file. You can also start browsing through and making changes based on the commands specified in Usage.md!
