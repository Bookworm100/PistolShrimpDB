# Setting up

This will tell you how to set up the key value store! Yay!
(Note: This has been only tested on Windows, but as far as I know it should work on all OSes)

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+
2. Retrieve the files from this GitHub repository - namely those titled PistolShrimpStoreDB.
3. Get JSON data (example data is available from https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD).
4. You can start running the program and have fun with the large amount of data! To do so, in the directory of your installation, run main.py.
5. You will be prompted for a filename to load data from.
6. Once the data is loaded to the key value stored, you will be prompted for a file name. The default is PistolShrimpStoreDB.bin. If it doesn't exist yet, you will have to specify a file name, perhaps one ending in .bin.
7. You will then see a message of the nature "Now we can do awesome stuff! You can exit the program with exit or quit if you want your changes saved, or with abort if you don't. You can also save your changes with save and undo them with undo!"
8. You can now run any of the commands specified in the usage, including the demo commands!

Bonus: If you're feeling up to it, you can start up the program and type "exit" to initially set up the storage file. You can also start browsing through and making changes based on the commands specified in the [Usage](https://github.com/Bookworm100/PistolShrimpDB/blob/master/Usage.md)!

And be sure to check out the [Demo](https://github.com/Bookworm100/PistolShrimpDB/blob/master/Demo.md)!
